        Front-end development is the practice of creating the user-facing
        aspects of a website or web application, essentially designing and
        building the visual elements that users directly interact with, like
        buttons, text, images, and navigation menus, using languages like HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a visually appealing and functional user
        experience; it's considered the "client-side" development, meaning it
        focuses on what the user sees on their screen rather than the backend
        server operations
      </p>
    </div>
  );
